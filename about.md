Hi !
I run this small website in French and English to share some personal experiences and solutions to problems that I find interesting in the various competitions I play. I often rank in the french top 10 in programming contests and computer security competitions (CTFs), but I'm always striving for improvement !

### More Information

I am currently not open to new professional opportunities, but fel free to try your luck on LinkedIn if you believe you have the 1-in-a-million offer. For now, I run a small freelance structure together with my brother Cl√©ment, we provide technical consulting and organization for competitions of any kind.

title: Advent of Code 2018 - solutions
---

Here are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2018, updated almost daily with new challenges.

If you are reading this in december 2018, you can join [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com), use the code `433401-91bb9f33` to join my friends leaderboard !

If you are playing the challenge, try not to read any of the solutions to problems you haven't solved.

The challenge is only for fun and there is nothing to win, so I think it's ok to publish them while the challenge is running. I might still publish the solutions to the harder problems only after the contest ends.

I will try to come up with simple and/or elegant solutions every day, and I would love to see yours ! Send them my way on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MathisHammel) :)

## <a name="day1"></a> Day 1 - [Link to the problems](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1)

### Part 1

```python
print sum(map(int, open('inputs/day1.txt').read().split()))
```

### Part 2

```python
l = map(int, open('inputs/day1.txt').read().split())

seen = set()
freq, i = 0, 0

while True:
    seen.add(freq)
    freq += l[i%len(l)]
    if freq in seen:
        print freq
        break
    i += 1
```

## <a name="day2"></a> Day 2 - [Link to the problems](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/2)

### Part 1

```python
import string

l = open('inputs/day2.txt').read().split()

print (sum(any(x.count(c)==2 for c in string.lowercase)for x in l) *
        sum(any(x.count(c)==3 for c in string.lowercase) for x in l))
```

My initial solve used [Counter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) objects, and was more efficient but harder to read.


### Part 2

```python
l = open('inputs/day2.txt').read().split()

for i in l:
    for j in l:
        if sum(a!=b for a,b in zip(i, j)) == 1:
            print ''.join(a if a==b else '' for a,b in zip(i, j))
            exit(0)
```

## <a name="day3"></a> Day 3 - [Link to the problems](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/3)

### Part 1

```python
import re

grid = [0]*1000000

for l in open('inputs/day3.txt').read().strip().split('\n'):
    a,b,c,d,e = map(int,re.findall(r'[\d]+', l))
    for i in range(b, b+d):
        for j in range(c, c+e):
            grid[i*1000+j] += 1

print len(filter(lambda x: x>1, grid))
```

### Part 2

```python
import re

grid = [0]*1000000
bad = set()

for l in open('inputs/day3.txt').read().strip().split('\n'):
    a,b,c,d,e = map(int,re.findall(r'[\d]+', l))
    for i in range(b, b+d):
        for j in range(c, c+e):
            if grid[i*1000+j]:
                bad.add(grid[i*1000+j])
                bad.add(a)
            grid[i*1000+j] = a

print set(range(1,a+1)) - bad
```

## <a name="day4"></a> Day 4 - [Link to the problems](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/4)

Today's solutions are presented to you by my brother Cl√©ment ([check out his Twitter](https://twitter.com/clement_hammel))

### Part 1

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import re

a = sorted(open('inputs/day4.txt').read().split('\n'))
d = defaultdict(lambda: [0]*60)

def lastNum(s):
    return int(re.findall(r"\d+", s)[-1])

for i in range(len(a)):
    if "begins shift" in a[i]:
        guard = lastNum(a[i])
    elif "wakes up" in a[i]:
        for j in range(lastNum(a[i-1]), lastNum(a[i])):
            d[guard][j] += 1

bestGuard = max(d, key=lambda x: sum(d[x]))
print(bestGuard * d[bestGuard].index(max(d[bestGuard])))
```

### Part 2

There's only a 3 byte difference between his solutions !

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import re

a = sorted(open('inputs/day4.txt').read().split('\n'))
d = defaultdict(lambda: [0]*60)

def lastNum(s):
    return int(re.findall(r"\d+", s)[-1])

for i in range(len(a)):
    if "begins shift" in a[i]:
        guard = lastNum(a[i])
    elif "wakes up" in a[i]:
        for j in range(lastNum(a[i-1]), lastNum(a[i])):
            d[guard][j] += 1

bestGuard = max(d, key=lambda x: max(d[x]))
print(bestGuard * d[bestGuard].index(max(d[bestGuard])))
```

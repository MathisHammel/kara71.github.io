We're a startup based in Paris, specialized in running custom-made technical competitions in coding and cybersecurity. As competitions enthusiasts, we thrive to design innovative contests and always keep our challengers on edge.

Many of our contests are made for our community, and accessible to everyone. We also organize private competitions for companies, to help reach your recruitment objectives in no time or to challenge your technical teams. Get in touch with us at contact@h25.io !

This blog is the space where we post interesting problems and solutions we made or found while playing competitions. This website is mostly run by our co-founder Mathis Hammel ([@MathisHammel](https://twitter.com/MathisHammel) on Twitter)
